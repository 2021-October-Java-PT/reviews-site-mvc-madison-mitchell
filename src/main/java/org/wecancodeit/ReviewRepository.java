                "Book", "Okay… deep breath and pray no-one kills me for this… I have a confession. I have never ever read a Sarah J Maas book! That might not sound so bad, but the thing is, I have actually met her (she is super nice and lovely) and have all of her books! I know the shame of failing at my bookworm goals… but now that’s changed! When I heard Maas was bringing out a modern fantasy retelling of Beauty and the Beast – my favourite Disney story of all time – I knew that the time was now and I had to read this book! I was super grateful when I was accidentally sold it in a book shop a month before its release, and I also received one from the Guardian to read and review! I wasn’t disappointed (and neither was my best mate, who got my spare copy).<br><br> A Court of Thorns and Roses is just as beautiful a book as the title suggests. It is set in a wondrous realm of faeries and mortals, and we are immediately thrown into Feyre’s world. She is a 19–year–old human literally fighting for survival in the cold, harsh lands which are her home, but when she kills a wolf, her life is changed forever. As it turns out, Feyre hasn’t only killed a wolf, but a Faerie, and she must now pay the price by leaving her family to enter the Fae lands and live there forever with her captor, Tamlin. Now, you might think that the book would continue with the Disney tale, but it becomes so much more, packed with adventure and life. It becomes an intensely gripping novel, not only about love, but also survival.<br><br> I initially thought this novel was quite slow, and almost gave up by page 50, but there was still a spark igniting my interest in the plot. The pace increased gradually, creating a tantalising story of great interest and passion. I honestly could not put it down! Instead, Maas’ writing led me to become a recluse for a few short hours: I almost sprinted through the pages, dancing with the words as my imagination became alive, before the book abruptly ended and left me hungry for the next in the series. I adored this book: I was hooked by the characters, the setting, the story and the words, and I honestly believe it could hold its own as a stand alone. <br><br> Now, the characters. First, we have Feyre, a strong, independent girl who knows her own mind and strives to save her loved ones. Despite being occasionally mistreated and unappreciated by her father and sister, she still continues to work in order to provide for them and to ensure that they are safe. I am praying that her relationship with Tamlin does not end up in a love triangle with Rhysand (Please Sarah J Maas, no love triangle!). Then we have Tamlin, who is, to be honest, perhaps the most honest and complex male protagonist I have ever encountered. We see multiple sides of him – shy and sweet, but also confident and strong – which have made me fall in love him myself (although I will let Feyre have him). Then we have Lucien, who is, without a doubt, one of the sassiest male characters I have ever experienced! His character, although secondary to Tamlin, is very important to the novel by providing great humour.<br><br> As a first time reader of Maas, I have to say that her writing style, although slow to begin with, is amazing and so beautiful. The way she writes is so delicate: perhaps the only way I could describe it would be as a piece of lace, so beautiful that it appears so fragile that you daren’t touch it. I have fallen in love with her writing, and now I am even more desperate to continue with this series and finally begin the Throne of Glass series! <br><br> Overall, I have been able to place this novel within the seven books which I have rated five stars so far this year. I loved it so much and advise anyone looking at this review to go and read the book now.",

        Review acomaf = new Review(2L, "\"Best Book Ever Written\"", "/images/acomaf.jpg", "Book", "Full disclosure? A Court of Thorns and Roses did NOT impress me, not until the very end, and not even that much then. <br><br> Full disclosure? This is probably because I was expecting a Celaena/Aelin and for three quarters of the book, Feyre was the exact opposite.<br><br> And so, A Court of Mist and Fury was not one of my most anticipated reads of this year, but I was going to be reading it anyway. And now, a few hours (28 hours, 42 minutes to be precise) after closing ACOMAF and staring at the walls because life without these characters is not worth it, I would sell my unborn child, a few limbs, a kidney and even bits of my soul for the next book. NOW. <br><br> Or, perhaps, to be transported to this world and never leave.<br><br> Or, perhaps, get to live with Rhys in his home, or in the Court of Dreams, or Velaris, or SOMEWHERE. Because for God’s sake, I’M DYING HERE AND I NEED SOMETHING. All ye great inventors, WHERE IS THE FICTIONAL WORLD TRANSPORTER? <br><br> Because it was perfect, wonderful, mind-blowing, brilliant, heart-wrecking, action-filled, swoon-worthy and EVERYTHING I never expected. A Court of Mist and Fury is Sarah Maas’s best work till date.<br><br> The second book picks up three months after the challenges Under The Mountain, in the Spring Court, with everyone still on edge. The horrors they all endured at Amarantha’s still plague their every moment, both waking and sleeping. The things that Feyre did for Tamlin, for Prythian made her lose herself and she doesn’t know how to salvage the shattered pieces.<br><br> Kept like a princess locked in a tower to protect her, Feyre is not allowed out of the Spring Court Manor. To protect her, Tamlin says. To make sure nothing and nobody can harm her ever again. On her hand, though, the tattoo reminds her of her bargain. The bargain she made in the darkest of nights, with night himself. One week, with him at the Night Court, once a month. But maybe Tamlin isn’t who Feyre thought he was, maybe Rhysand isn’t the monster everybody believes he is. Maybe the immortal high fae with the human heart isn’t who she used to be – maybe she’s more. Maybe she’s what this broken world needs.<br><br> I’m not going to go further into what this book is about, but as I write this review all this time later I’m still feeling all the feels. ALL OF THEM. This book was so beautiful, I find myself at a loss for words.<br><br> I loved the depth of each and every character, the way Maas makes you feel every move, every bit of darkness, every bit of swoon and ship her characters like nobody else has the power to. A Court of Mist and Fury is dark, seductive, wonderful, brilliant – a masterpiece.<br><br> A million star and the highest praise for the best fantasy I’ve ever read.",

        Review acowar = new Review(3L, "\"A Great Wrap Up of the Best Trilogy\"", "/images/acowar.jpg",
                "Book", "Feyre has returned to the Spring Court, determined to gather information on Tamlin’s manoeuvrings and the invading king threatening to bring Prythian to its knees. But to do so she must play a deadly game of deceit – and one slip may spell doom not only for Feyre, but for her world as well. <br><br> As war bears down upon them all, Feyre must decide who to trust amongst the dazzling and lethal High Lords – and hunt for allies in unexpected places. <br><br> In this thrilling third book in the #1 New York Times bestselling series from Sarah J. Maas, the earth will be painted red as mighty armies grapple for power over the one thing that could destroy them all. <br><br> A Court of Wings and Ruin is the third book in this series and concludes the main original trilogy. And wow was it a good conclusion. While I didn’t enjoy A Court of Mist and Fury as much as the first book, I absolutely loved A Court of Wings and Ruin. People seem to rave over ACOMAF, but it was too slow in places for me and I felt that book was dragged out a bit too much (although I still liked it, just not as much as the others!). ACOWAR on the other hand kept the pace and suspense up all the way through. The stakes were high, I was invested in the characters and I was hooked from start to finish. <br><br> This book has a huge cast and I loved most of them. I loved seeing Feyre as High Lady and adjusting to her new role (also it was really satisfying seeing other characters, especially High Lords, react to realising she’s High Lady). Then there’s the inner circle, Mor, Amren, Cassian and Azriel, and the addition of Nesta and Elain. I liked seeing Feyre’s sisters have a bigger role in this book as we got to see her interact with them more. <br><br> The amount of twists and turns in this book was unbelievable. It’s building up to the final climactic battle between Prythian and Hybern, but along the way there is plenty of suspense and twists. I devoured the last 100 or so pages, with my moods shifting from elation to tears and back again over and over. When I closed the book, I felt satisfied with the conclusion. ACOWAR is a great ending to this trilogy. <br><br> It wasn’t quite amazing enough for me to give 5 stars though. In the final battle there are a couple of times where characters conveniently appear somewhere (just in time to kill someone, for example) just completely out of nowhere, and I was left thinking but how did that character get there? They were all the way over there. And how that happened was never explained so I was left being a bit frustrated because it was a really important moment. <br><br> I would have liked more character deaths. That feels like a weird thing to say. I love the characters and of course I don’t want them to die! But there’s a humungous epic battle but so few named characters die. Surely in everything that happens in this book someone would die, right? Unless Maas is saving tragic character deaths for future books! My poor heart! There is a novella called A Court of Frost and Starlight already released and future books planned too. <br><br> ACOWAR is a spectacular conclusion to this first trilogy. I know this series isn’t perfect, but I still can’t wait to devour more...",

        Review outlander = new Review(4L, "\"Some Like It Scot\"", "/images/outlander.jpg", "Book", "When Claire Randall and her husband go to a second honeymoon at the Highlands in order to reconnect as a couple after WWII she never expected to be thrown inadvertently back in time, in the year of 1743 when the English and the Scots were at not so peaceful grounds. She suddenly becomes a Sassenach, an Outlander, and has to face clans and lairds and other things she’s only ever read about in history. And now she’s back again to being Claire Beauchamp. <br><br> When she travels back in time, she immediately falls into the hands of a captain of the dragoons, Jonathan Randall, an ancestor of her husband. Many call him Black Jack for his soul is dark. He jumps on her but she is saved by clansmen. Due to her being a nurse during WWII she helps save a young Scot man that is severely hurt and is taken back to Castle Leoch. The place where those who belong at the clan of Colum Mackenzie reside. <br><br> \"For where love is, the speaking is unnecessary.\"<br><br> She has to face the suspicion and the doubt surrounding her by simply looking the other way while trying to be inconspicuous about where she comes from and how she came to be here. Everyone thinks she’s an English spy and on top of that she has to face her own feelings and confusion of being thrown back in time. She’s baffled and scared but still she handles it well. Claire is a really strong character and she adapts quickly. She’s not easily scared, she’s survived severed hands and torn soldiers and she sure as hell can get through this. <br><br> When she is discovered by English soldiers and is taken back into interrogation she is forced to come face to face, once again, with Captain Randall and plays her card with him. Dougal Mackenzie announces her that she is to be married. The only way of her ever slipping through Randall’s fingers is if she takes Scottish citizenship by marrying a fellow Scot. She is to be married to Jamie Fraser, the lad she had saved back when she had first found herself in the hands of the clansmen and the only person she felt relaxed and easy around. Let’s go back a bit. <br><br> \"Met one month, married one day. Bound by vows and by blood. And by friendship as well. When the time came to leave, I hoped that I would not hurt too badly.\" <br><br> Claire is one of those headstrong characters that once she sets her mind and eyes on something she’ll do about anything in order to reach her goal. She is pigheaded, she always wants to do it her way. She’s independent and she doesn’t need anyone. At least, that was until she met Jamie Fraser. He is beautiful and he is young and he is gentle and he’s the only one of the clansmen who’s a bit more civilized and more lettered. <br><br> Jamie Fraser. Full name: James Alexander Malcolm Mackenzie Fraser is an amazing character who is also the nephew of Colum and Dougal Mackenzie, and he’s a fugitive of the law. He’s caring and protective of those he loves; He’s strong and snarky the only one who can handle Claire. Jamie Fraser is the only one Claire trusts and the only she feels she can talk to. <br><br> Once they get married, things get heated. Claire, even though she is married she cannot deny her attraction towards Jamie and Jamie is most glad that he doesn’t have to hold back his feelings any more. <br><br> \"One never stops to think what underlies romance. Tragedy and terror, transmuted by time. Add a little art in the telling, and voila! a stirring romance, to make the blood run fast and the maidens sigh.\" <br><br> One never stops to think what underlies romance. Tragedy and terror, transmuted by time. Add a little art in the telling, and voila! a stirring romance, to make the blood run fast and the maidens sigh. <br><br> Outlander by Diana Gabaldon is not just romance, though romance is a big part of it and it’s one of the best things about it. This book is about seeing the gap of generations, seeing how in 200 hundred years so many things have changed, not only epochal, but also people.. People have changed, their ways of mind and heart are completely different and Claire is forced to adapt or die. In Outlander, Diana Gabaldon does a wonderful and thorough job of that. Her captivating and detailed writing is incredible. Her dialogues are amazing. She has created a plot so rich, with twists, fun and a romance that takes your breath away forever. It’s also nice to see how Claire and Jamie work through their problems, how a love blossoms between them, so pure and so strong that they won’t stop at anything in order to be together. <br><br> Even though there many details, many characters and a constant change of scenery the book never felt boring. Not for a second. Mrs. Gabaldon would always find something to keep your mind focused on her storytelling. She’s pretty resourceful and has lots of things to give. <br><br> \"“Sometimes our best action result in things that are most regrettable.\" <br><br> Outlander by Diana Gabaldon really picked up from halfway on. The book was insane until the first half but then things got out of control. Also, it’s humorous at times and that makes up for all the drama and it’s very nice that both our characters are snarky and not afraid of telling one another how they really feel. Their relationship seems so genuine and so real. I can’t really talk about them without getting emotional. <br><br> Mrs. Gabaldon is a master at romance just as she is a master at storytelling and keeping you on the edge. She can create hot and heavy scenes between our characters, with vivid narration that makes your blood run high. That’s about it. The ending is really, really satisfying.",

        Review crescentCity = new Review(5L, "\"Memento Mori\"", "/images/crescentcity.jpg", "Book", "Outside of the spectacular personal brand that Sarah J. Maas has built over the years, one of the other things I love about her is how she’s able to capture an entire aesthetic in her prose. She has this ability to make the reader vividly see the characters, surroundings and their actions as she writes. <br><br> I saw many complaining about there being too much info-dumping and world-building in this book, but I would actually argue that this book has the least convoluted world-building I’ve read in a fantasy book. <br><br> But while I thoroughly enjoyed reading Crescent City and was entertained throughout all 816 pages, I cannot call it the perfect book. The book is marketed as adult fantasy, but when put up against other adult fantasy works it is nothing alike. <br><br> I believe the only thing that deems this adult fantasy is the fact that her characters are older than the ones in Maas’s previous books. But they generally act the exact same way her characters would act in her New Adult books. This left me asking the question, what exactly does separate this book from A Court of Mist and Fury? (My previous favourite Maas book.) <br.<br> There’s tons more swearing, the characters are ‘older’, and instead of coming up with creative ways to refer to a penis, she flat out calls it a cock. But besides that, this book wasn’t exactly the kind of adult fantasy I was expecting. Either her previous books are already adult fantasy, or this one reads just like her NA/YA books. <br><br> Another thing I expected to see in Maas’ adult work, is more varied characters. And I don’t just mean characters of a different colour—which, she had a few in here. But they’re not exactly main characters that were present the whole way through—I mean characters who are completely unalike. But it seems like every one in Crescent City is a super model-like specimen who is attractive to all; including Bryce herself. Sure, Maas’ beautiful world pallet is something that separates her brand and makes her books standout, but again, in adult fantasy I believe more depth and variety should be given to readers. Even if the main cast are beautiful, powerful beings, why not have some supporting cast who are more varied in their looks and abilities? <br><br> My criticisms could just be a result of me misunderstanding what was meant by “adult fantasy” here, and in which case, I must commend Sarah J. Maas on another book full of dazzling escapism. But as someone who reads a ton of mature/adult books, I was expecting something that would enter the same realm but also have Maas’ signature fantasy aesthetic and prose. <br><br> THE VERDICT <br><br> I want to be clear in saying that this is still one of my favourite Maas books period. I just had different expectations for it and in every review I write there’s a need to be critical. <br><br> With that being said, I recommend the book to anyone who has loved a Maas book (or something similar) and wants to try something in the urban fantasy realm. But if you’re expecting Game of Thrones or Black Leopard Red Wolf, then Crescent City is something quite different. Make sure you have the right expectations going in and there will be a ton to enjoy here. <br><br> Whenever a sequel comes, I’ll be the first in line to pre-order. Because Maas did create a new and fascinating world for new stories to be told.",
